# Security Policy

This project is complete and is now in maintenance mode.

As a result changes, new releases are 
* dependency updates due to security patches (rare)
* bug-fixes (rarer)
* PR merges (extremely rare)

More to the point, most of the vulnerabilities only apply to use of these libraries in a browser.

## So... 
If you find a bug or think you've found a genuine vulnerability, raise an issue or better yet fix it and submit a PR.
