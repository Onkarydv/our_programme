Print code. Print rendered Markdown. Local or remote. Windows, Mac or Linux.

## Cross-platform printing

Print-jobs are rendered as styled HTML and served from an embedded webserver. Your local web browser is launched to load the print-job and give you printing options like paper size, page orientation and margin size. 

So if you have a local browser that can print, and VS Code can launch it, you can print.

## Markdown

## Classic user experience

The print icon on the toolbar prints the document in the active editor.

If you have a text selection that crosses at least one line-break you can right click and choose `Print` from the context menu to send just the selection to the printer. In the absence of a multi-line selection the entire document is printed. You can control the position of `Print` in this menu, or remove it altogether.

Or you can right-click on a file in the file explorer pane and choose Print from the context menu.

## Highly configurable

There are a number of settings. Most of them you just need to read the descriptions on the settings page, but we're old school and [we wrote a manual.](https://github.com/PDConSec/vsc-print/blob/HEAD/doc/manual.eng.md) If things aren't going well, consider reading it. If you have first-use problems, the manual contains a [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PDConSec/vsc-print/blob/HEAD/doc/manual.eng.md#troubleshooting).

Some things you can configure:

- the colour scheme used for syntax colouring
- whether or not you want line numbers
- alternate browser for printing
- line spacing (leave yourself more room for handwritten annotation of code)

## Planned changes

Machine translation to support major languages. 
This has already been applied to the extension and its settings but high quality automated translation of documentation is proving more difficult.
